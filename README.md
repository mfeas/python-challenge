Module three challenge

For PyBank I put the corresponding given image into the analysis folder.
I had trouble getting my path join function to operate properly and had help
from the ask bcs staff. After getting it written and getting myself into the
correct folder to test run my code I was able to create a working for loop where
I was able to practice using my variables and adding in functions such as float to
get my numbers to operate properly and be formatted accordingly.
I used the formatting provided on bcs to create my print statements and was able to
pick up another new tool- using \n to start a new line. While I had seen it before
putting it into practice was nice and helped make my code clean, simpler and look
how it was supposed to.
Lastly with the assistance of Bing AI I was able to take my print statement code
that worked in terminal and put it into a new text file! The AI guided me through
setting up the write function and printing into my new file. I test ran my code a
few times and was able to get consistent results.

For PyPoll it was pretty simple to follow the skeleton of the work I did in PyBank
and adjust it to the data I was given for elections versus profits and losses. The
only thing that really tripped me up was that my new analysis file would work- I would
get a new .txt file but the results wouldn't be in the new file. I was able to rewrite
my original print statements into f.write statements and it would print (or write?)
into the new .txt file. The formatting was wonky though so I had to add the \n to
create a fresh line every time or my "-----" and my "Total Votes:" ended up all
squashed together in one line. After getting my formatting sorted using the second
style of print/write to get my .txt file working properly for PyBank main.py I went
through and moved around my files and visually inspected my code for "cleanliness".

I made an effort to commit to git as often as possible to track my progress as I
worked. I used ask bcs and Bing AI to find whatever I was struggling with and research
and read until I was able to find something that helped me create my code. Using stack
overflow, W3 schools and python libraries to learn and put to use new methods and practice
things we had gone over in class.

I do feel as though I got a pretty good handle on Python and how to find what I needed as
I went. I'm sure there were cleaner and simpler ways to write some portions of this but
overall I think I got it pretty well written. :)
